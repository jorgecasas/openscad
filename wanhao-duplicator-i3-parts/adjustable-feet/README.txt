# Summary

i just added a foot for an actual o-ring (size =11/16"x 7/16"x 1/8")  
im using this one now and it works realy nice.the o-ring holds in nice and tight but also gives you plenty meat under the foot for cushion.   
added v4 as a request . also used and scaled down this item http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31986  for the foot.  
added a v3 with a ninjaflex bubble for vibration.  
added a oring style cutout foot v2.  
i added a ninjaflex cutout foot  as requested.   

i decided to create adjustable feet for the duplicator i3 to get rid of the rocking motion mine gets while sitting on my desk.  
and also i have read that other people had wanted adjustable feet to level off there printers.  
it just slips on the frame so you can place them where ever you want and have as many as you want to level off your machine  

im printing up 6 pairs right now and will post pictures when finnished.

# Instructions

brace and foot printed in pla   
2 shells  
0.2mm layer height  
60 infill.  
the caps and orings for the feet print in ninjaflex..  
i dont do ninjaflex yet but some asked for models.   
pleases let me know if everything works.
