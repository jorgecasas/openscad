# Summary

This is a simple holder for the allen wrenches that come with the Wanhao Duplicator I3 V2. It's nothing fancy, but it does the job. Please feel free to improve it and/or remix it. If you make it, please upload photos.

In one of the pictures you can see a little damage I caused while removing it. I was too impatient and removed it while it was still warm.

UPDATE-1
Reloaded the file (WrenchHolder5). Beefed up the clips, cleaned up some corners, got rid of some loose polygons, and flipped the file.

Hopefully it will make it stronger.
